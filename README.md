# Do not know how use .md  
but a leading # is a heading  

A link ist done this way [text]{url} as on  
[markdownwiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is here.

This is a simple line, without any decoration. I hope the 
the lines are properly aligned. but i need to integrate some **bold text** here.

And this is the next paragraph, also with a litte more than
one line. And will use no special information.

## This whole thing ist only for tests
And this comes after a subheading with ## on the beginning

I hope to learn more on in the next days. In this environment 
I am the first time aktive writer. Used many open source
projects and will eventualy contribute.
